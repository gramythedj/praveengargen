We are a group of engineering students studying in India and we follow and watch anime content and we share content related to anime in this website and we share our ideas and theories and comparisons of different anime like Naruto, Dragon Ball, One-piece and the list goes on.  

We believe that every anime gives us some lessons on what to do and what not to do. Where to talk or not.
