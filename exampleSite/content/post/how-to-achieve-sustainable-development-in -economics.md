## How to achieve Sustainable development?

  

According to Dailey , he formulated 3 important principles

  

1.  Rate of Use of non Renewable(coal petrol etc should not surpass rate of their regeneration).
    
2.  Rate of using non renewables should not be greater than rate at which substitutes are available.
    
3.  Carrying capacity (the rate at which resources and polluting materials disposed of do not exceeds the carrying capacity of environment)
