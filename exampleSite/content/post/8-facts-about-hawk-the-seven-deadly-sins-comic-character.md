8 facts about Hawk, the seven deadly sins comic character
=========================================================

Hawk acts as The Seven Deadly Sins' comic relief, but even hardcore fans may not be aware of these tidbits about his character.

some of the most endearing characters in the shounen genre make up the cast of the Seven Deadly Sins. One of which is the talking pig Hawk, usually found in shounen series, who acts as the mandatory comedic relief character. Hawk is the equivalent of Dragonball's Oolong to The Seven Deadly Sins, being that he is responsible for the funniest moments and quotes of the series.

He ain't a pig
--------------

Yeah, the title of that entry does not lie. He might look like a pig, he might eat like a pig, but he's no pig. In fact, Hawk is a creature from Purgatory that looks like a pig. The same goes for his Wild, a Purgatory-like boar creature.

In general, the indigenous denizens of Purgatory mimic normal animals but with visible demonic characteristics. They are often used to the intolerable circumstances of Purgatory, as they were born there.

He's Unknowingly The Demon King's Spy
-------------------------------------

There is a reason why Hawk left Purgatory, and it was not his own will. The King of the Demons abducted Hawk from his brother and banished him to the realm of living. Everything for the sake of Hawk being used to spy on his son, Meliodas. Hawk is a living gateway, according to his wiki page, which links the purgatory to the living world. Which in turn enables the Demon King, by peering through Hawk 's eyes, to spy on Meliodas.

His Name's Original Translation Was Hork
----------------------------------------

Mild isn't yet another alias for Hawk. The original name translation of Captain Leftover was originally Hork, with his Romanized name being Hawk. That his name 's original translation rhymes with pork is quite amusing. There's more to his original name translation than that, Rhyming coincidences aside.

"In urban English, Hork can be described as vomit, according to his wiki page. This applies to the manga, as it is sometimes shown to clean up the vomit of the customer." Hork seems to be a fitting name for him in retrospect.

  

He has Brother
--------------

  

Hawk turns out not to be a single child. Hawk's got an older brother with the name Wild. With Wild serving his role as the protective older brother, the two brothers shared a caring sibling bond. One day, because of the Demon King, Meliodas' father, the brothers are sadly separated from each other.

Wild spent the next million years scouring the hellish dimension for his long lost brother, in the time of Purgatory. Throughout his time in Purgatory, Wild has built an infamous reputation for himself from his various battles with the Demon King.

  

Mild is his real name
---------------------

That's right, Hawk isn't even his real name, it turns out. His real name is Mild, actually. This was the name that Hawk was given at birth. Of course, his name was changed when, with his mother, Hawk Mama, he was brought to the living realm.

Hawk and his mother has led a quiet life inside a forest for quite some time since leaving Purgatory. Hawk, unconscious and lying on the side of the road, stumbled upon Meliodas one day. And so, that marked the beginning of their wonderfully dysfunctional relationship.

  

Hawk is sixteen years old,
--------------------------

  

that Hawk's birthplace has been revealed, it only seems fitting to reveal his age. Hawk is sixteen years old. It made him one of Team Seven Deadly Sins' youngest members, linked to Elizabeth. Also, he is undeniably the group's least strong.

So, literally, Hawk is a teenager. Even though he's 16 years old, that could be years in his race. So Hawk may be much older than what his age suggests

  
  
  

  

Born in Purgatory
-----------------------

Originally, Hawk was born in Purgatory. A nightmarish world found between the afterlife and the realm of living. They would not last long in a place with such intolerable circumstances that any mere human would visit there. Merlin's father, for example, was a few decades older and he was there for just one minute.

It is understandably difficult to believe that anyone like Hawk was born and survived there. Especially when there are other strong characters who have a better chance of survival.
