## The Ultimate Guide of starting a blog in 2023

 

  There are a few things to consider if you want to start a blog in the next few days or if you want to start a new blog. 
-To begin, if you are new to blogging, it is critical to begin with simple steps and concepts so that you can get started quickly and easily. 
-Second, ensure that your blog is properly set up so that your readers can see what you have to say. Finally, make sure you stay up-to-date on blogging trends so your content is fresh and engaging.

## Why do people start blogs?

  
Some people start blogs to share their knowledge expertise or to share their ideas on specific topics, which is known as hobby blogging, while others start blogs as a side hustle to earn money. Whatever the reason, many people's ultimate goal is to earn money or to share their knowledge with others.



Blogging is a popular way to share information and network with others. Many people want to start their own blogs in the future.



## Blogging software to choose

There are many blogging softwares to choose from, such as Wordpress, Joomla, Google Blogger, Medium, Hashnode, and others. In this tutorial, we will focus on WordPress because it is easy to set up and also SEO friendly.
 Furthermore, 35% of internet websites are created with Wordpress, and it is a free opensource software with tonnes of tutorials online, whereas other software is popular, but most of them do not have nice tutorials online, so the learning curve will be higher.

  

## Step 5. Design Your Blog With a WordPress Theme

Make minimalism your priority in making a blog, we don’t want a blog with heavy designs and plugins.

Minimalist blog design is a key strategy for small businesses. Minimalism is the way of life and it should be the goal of all bloggers. That said, if you want to create a successful minimalist blog, don’t forget about making sure your content is high-quality and engaging.

there are plenty of free WordPress themes out there that can help you take your website to the next level.

  

One great option is Generate Press, which is available for free on WordPress.com. This theme has a sleek design and easy-to-use features, so it's perfect for small businesses or individual bloggers who want to create a professional website without spending a lot of money.

  

Another great option is Astra, which is also available for free on WordPress.com.

I generally avoid writing directly in the WordPress editor because it is more difficult to use, and the new Gutenberg editor is not user-friendly for newcomers.

I recommend that you use Google Docs or any other free text Editor pads that are available on the market.



  For adding images/buttons, you can use those features, they are directly available in WordPress text editor

  



  

## Pick a Hosting platform

  
  ### Best Hosting platform for Beginners
 

 - [bluehost :](https://www.bluehost.com/track/dudesasori/)
       
       
 -   [dreamhost :](https://mbsy.co/ThjpS)
       
       
 -    [scala hosting:](https://www.scalahosting.com/#sodiumboy) 
       
       
 -   [hostinger:](https://www.hostg.xyz/aff_c?offer_id=6&aff_id=33902) 
       
       
 -   [Siteground:](https://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=b9acf2736a8692d61647625d11393ed2)
       
       
       
 -   [cloudways:](https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=1028076)

Let’s take a simple scenario, if you want to open a sports shop, then the place you rent is called hosting, without that place you can’t open a shop or place your materials

  

Hosting a website is an important aspect of any blog or website. In order to keep your site running smoothly, you need to be sure that you have the right tools and services in place. Here are some tips on how to start a blog in 2023:

  

Make sure your website is hosting correct. Hosting can make or break your site. Make sure that you're using the best hosting service out there and make sure that your website is up-to-date with new features and updates.

for starters, you can choose A2 hosting or Bluehost, they don’t cost that much and comes with many pre-built themes and templates

  

## Choose a name/domain for your new blog

### Best Domain name Providers

- namecheap.com
- Godaddy.com
- Google Domains
  

Next important thing is Name, now you want to open a sports shop, the name will be your domain name for example you want to open a shop called Pluto sports shop, and the name of your domain would be [plutosports.com](http://plutosports.com/) or any other international domain extensions like .co, .org, .net etc

  

Have a domain name for your blog. If you don't have a domain name, use one that's registered with a webhosting company. Domain names are essential for keeping track of who runs your blog and for SEO purposes.

  

Generally people prefer to choose global extensions like .com, .org, .net or country level domains extensions like .it for Italy, .co.uk for the United Kingdom or .in for India

    

## Step 4. Get familiar with WordPress, your blogging software

<figure > <img src="/images/how-to-blog-2023/2.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Wordpress Dashboard" style="border: 1px solid #BBB" /> <figcaption>Basic wordpress</figcaption> </figure>  

first thing to do before writing blog posts is trying to learn how WordPress works and do some settings changes like permalink and watch some beginner videos on how to use WordPress.

  

The more you get comfortable with WordPress, the quicker you will write blog posts so that, you can be more creative and do lots of research on content marketing, rather than fixing plugins on WordPress and always changing designs on the blog etc

WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) that allows users to create and manage websites. While there are many different ways to set up WordPress, the process of learning how it works and setting up your blog is critical if you want to take your website to the next level.

  

Once you have created an account, login and click on the “create blog” button. The next screen will ask you how much content you want to write in your blog and how many pages you want your blog to have. You can choose between two different types of blogs: small or large.


## Do not Bloat the blog with plugins.

<figure > <img src="/images/how-to-blog-2023/5.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Wordpress Plugins" style="border: 1px solid #BBB" /> <figcaption>Basic Wordpress Plugins</figcaption> </figure> 

When you first start a blog, don't add tonnes of plugins because it will slow down the page speed and has a lot of javascript code, which will hurt the website's performance in the long run. Instead, use only necessary plugins like Classic Editor, Google Site kit, and so on.


<figure > <img src="/images/how-to-blog-2023/8.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Google site Kit" style="border: 1px solid #BBB" /> <figcaption>Google Site Kit</figcaption> </figure>

for adding plugins go to 

-Wordpress Dashboard > Plugins > Add New Buttons > Search Plugins Name > Install Plugin > Activate Plugin

## Find the right niche

  

Niche is very important nowadays, and it’s an integral part of the long term SEO strategy.

  

My simple advice is do not add different topics in a single blog for example you are building a sports shop or sports blog, add blog posts which discuss sports items or sports wear or sports gear but do not add off-topic niches like home products., kitchen products etc

  

just choose a broad niche and work in sub niches, really speaking these niche games are inception in inception

  

## Brainstorm blog topics

  

After selecting niche, next step is keyword research and brainstorming topics to write about certain topics

  

## Start with keyword research

  

Honestly speaking there are lots of keywords research software out there which are pretty good like SEMRUSH and AHREF but they cost a little bit too much, ideally speaking if you are single persons who want to start blogging then free keyword research tools are available like google keyword planner and also use Google auto search feature.

  

And if you are really starting business then it is very much advisable to use SEMRUSH or AHREF, because Growth is what matters most in a serious business

  
## Get your blog outline

   <figure > <img src="/images/how-to-blog-2023/12.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Blog Outline" style="border: 1px solid #BBB" /> <figcaption>blog outline</figcaption> </figure>

Now that you have a domain and hosting account, it's time to set up your blog outline. There are countless tutorials and tips out there on how to do this, but we'll take a basic approach here and walk you through everything needed.

  
### steps for creating a blog outline

1. think about what you want to write 
2. go to frase.io or any other outline generator like surfer SEO outline generator
3. write down your main idea 
4. It will generate your blog outline based on a SERPS analysis.
5. Based on the generated ideas, you can easily brainstorm more and write articles.


  

## Write your first blog post

  

After doing brainstorming, it’s time to write the first blog post or first article you want to write , don’t think too much on word count, just write whatever you think, type and publish it.

  

  

## Customize your blog with SEO

  

now the important thing in any online businesses is SEO, structuring your blog post with regarding SEO.

 <figure > <img src="/images/how-to-blog-2023/9.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="ALL in One SEO" style="border: 1px solid #BBB" /> <figcaption>ALL in One SEO</figcaption> </figure> 

SEO is not a tool or software, it’s just some guidelines used by search engines like Google, Bing, Duck Duck Go etc.

  

My humble guide on SEO is, don’t try to focus too much on SEO software products , just try to create content which is helpful to visitors on your blog, just make sure your content is not too thin like 100-200 words, for starters at least make sure it’s above 500 words

Add a plugin called All in One Seo or Yoast Seo, both of which are generally good and come with some nice features like sitemap creation, robots.txt creation, and blog post SEO score.

Do not rely on these scores; they are simply guidelines to help you improve your articles. They are useful when improving article headlines and structuring content.

  

### Content that should be on Your Blog

  

always write content which are relevant, don’t try to add different niches in a single website, I have seen a lot of novice bloggers, who add tech, gaming, gadgets, finance, health, etc. all niches in a single menu and couldn’t have laser focus strategy on content marketing

If you're anything like me, you're always looking for ways to improve your blog presence. Whether it's creating new content or tweaking an old post, there are always ways to make your blog more engaging and relevant. Here are a few tips to help get started:

  

1. Try not to add different niches in a single website. This can quickly become tiresome and difficult to keep up with the ever-changing online landscape. Instead, focus on content that is both useful and interesting for your target audience.

2. Be sure to regularly publish new posts. This will keep your blog updated and relevant, and will help people find what they're looking for when they search for information on your blog.

3. Write helpful articles that are easy to read and follow up with questions or comments after reading them.
