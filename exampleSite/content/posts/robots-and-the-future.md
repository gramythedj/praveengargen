## Can robots rule us in the near future?

Some people express that super artificial intelligence will take control of the earth(popularly 
called AI takeover), and super artificial intelligence is inevitable. Famous Brains like Elon Musk 
and Stephen Hawking considered that and advocated performing research on preventive measures (AI 
Alignment). I highly doubt if robots and artificial intelligence could evolve to a certain extent 
that they would take over humanity because of the following reasons:

## Energy problem:

Suppose super artificial intelligence(SAI) could be powerful, efficient and enormous. It should 
consume a lot of electricity to perform tasks better than humans. As the programming develops to 
become more and more advanced, to function, it should at least use 100 times the energy we use 
today (as we humans get our energy from food to match our work, robots' only source is 
electricity). To reach the need for power, they would need to burn up the entire coal on earth to 
sustain for a year. if you think 100 times is too large, how about ten even so they cannot make it 
to the next decade(assuming that coal will be available readily)

How do robots produce so much power? You might be thinking of renewable energy sources like solar 
power. I doubt if that's possible as well. With an efficiency of converting less than 22% of solar 
energy into electricity, and there is no production during the night, It should cut a large portion 
of the forest for that energy scale. 

It might cause sufficient global warming and has a high 
possibility of ozone depletion resulting in highly harmful radiation to electronic materials and, 
large cut down of trees would result in increase in soil erosion which is not good electronic 
devices so they can't afford to cut such large trees to survive. As far as we know, there is no 
alternative power source, so eventually, large scale super artificial intelligence will have to 
fall in one way or the other.

## Lack of greed:

People are worried that robots will take over the Earth because they are greedy. Humans are always 
greedy about others (I'm not judging if it is right or wrong) and worried if someone might steal 
their position. They are applying this to robots as one-day robots might control us.
Computers lack greed. No matter how efficient you make a computer, it can't match the greediness of 
humans.

## Energy storage problem:

Resources for battery storage are minimal. Mobility should be easy if robots want to take over 
Earth. Moving from one place to another needs power highly efficient batteries. With the current 
technology we have, Li-ion batteries are more efficient. Unless they develop far better



alternatives, it would be a huge challenge with the available lithium. and there would be many such 
shortage of resources problems.

## Aging sooner:

It looks like robots are more sensitive than humans. They age sooner than humans. Today computers 
become ineffective in Syears, and they would be poor functioning in less than a decade. And we need 
to throw them away. This is because the chips get less efficient because of their constant use. 
This happens everywhere; continuous use of atoms repeatedly would decrease the system's efficiency.


A well-developed system in the human body will replace 98%of all atoms present in your body, which 
makes us better functioning. Inside a computer chip, there is no method by which new atoms go into 
hardware and automatically replace the old ones without affecting the system's functions. If robots 
plan to take over the world, they should develop a new process to overcome the problem of ageing. 
That process should be able to collect the atoms, replace the atoms wherever needed, and dispose of 
the used atoms without affecting the system's functions.

## Rest

We assume that robots don't need rest like humans. It is not true after all; when robots work, 
there is a release in heat energy. Higher the work, the higher the heat production. High Heat 
production could damage the hardware inside the devices, so they need to be stopped for a while to 
cool down.

## No escape from Natural calamities:

Even Robots can't escape from natural calamities. Radiations, solar flares, and cyclones would 
impact robots. Rains could significantly impact electronics that are very frequent on earth. Even 
dust causes significant damage to the walking computers.

Note: This is my opinion and I would be very much interested to know your opinion on the matter.
