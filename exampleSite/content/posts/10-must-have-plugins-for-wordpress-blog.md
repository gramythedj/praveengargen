## 1. Yoast SEO
Actually, WordPress (CMS) comes with Better SEO Than any other CMS, while if we add this Yoast SEO plugin then It extends SEO optimization to the next level, This plugin allows you to specify which pages can be indexed by Google and which ones shouldn’t be.

It also provides XML sitemaps, RSS optimization features, optimization for Meta tags and links, social media integration and much more.

So it is easier for us to concentrate more on content than that SEO optimization, and if you are not a fan of Yoast SEO, then you can also use All in SEO plugin, and They are also first players in the SEO industry and also Claims to downloaded 50 million times, which is quite a large number.

 ## 2.wp-optimize/Regenerate thumbnails/Smush
 

I actually use almost 3 plugins to optimize the website’s Speed and Make it Efficient, with just one click, Wp-optimize does clean the database and also compresses the images, and caches pages faster, and this makes the website load at a faster speed, which is good for user point of view, not only I use wp-optimize, the other plugins are Smush and Regenerate thumbnails.

Though these two plugins have the same purpose of speeding the website, I just use three of them, just to be in safe hands.

 

 
## 3.BackupGuard
Many new bloggers consider that backup plugins are not so useful and they even never install one, but with my 1-year blog experiment I found out that most of the time I change the niche/theme, so in this process, I tried a lot of themes, but when changing the themes and trying 1 click imports then, everything gets dispersed, so again you want to try the previous versions of your blog, in this case, a backup plugin helps really well, and I prefer backup guard as they provide a Free Version.

Note: in case of Hack-attack or malicious files, our website gets down, so you need to make sure your website is backed-up in some way, normally hosting providers give an option of backing up our website daily or Weekly, but they didn’t give them you need to set it up with help of plugins, try different back-up plugins which work fast and Reliable.

 

## 4. Anti-spam bee
Antispam Bee blocks spam comments and trackbacks effectively, without captchas and without sending personal information to third-party services.

It is free of charge, ad-free and Most importantly it is needed for new Bloggers and Bloggers who have heavy traffic because through the comment section most of them will try to spam by sending links to another website, and for new bloggers even though the traffic is less still they get comments with malicious links because it is done by Bots, so be free from them we have to use the anti-spam plugins, as an anti-spam bee.



 

## 5. Amp Plugin (Accelerated mobile pages)
Though I recommend this plugin for those who work with news-related websites and magazines related and also all types of entertainment websites like movie reviews, Hollywood or Bollywood news, and gossip websites.

Because more number of visitors to these types of websites are from mobile users and Google gives more priority to amp pages, which are lightning-fast, but I do not recommend this to Guide type of websites or how to Tech Related, still I am using it, because I am testing this on my own website lets see what are the results in the future.

 

## 6. Google Analytics for WordPress by MonsterInsights
This Plugin is very handy in use because every time, we need not go to the Google analytics website to check our web traffic and other settings like user behavior, but with this plugin, there will be a dashboard in the WordPress admin itself and you can see much-needed stats and analytics like which pages are in the top and how much traffic you have and from where the visitors are coming, so I recommend these plugins to all who check stats very often and learn from the stats.

## 7. LuckyWP Table of Contents
Creates an SEO-friendly table of contents for your posts, pages, or custom post types. Great customizable appearance. if you write long content then it is a must plugin as it will give users where the real content is and it is easy for them to navigate through your blog.

## 8. Contact form
Contact Form 7 permits you to include and deal with various contact forms on your site. It supports Ajax submissions, and the Akismet spam filter included with WordPress and CAPTCHAs. The most recent version offers full help for language packs, an improved manager interface, different availability, and ease of use enhancements, and various bug fixes. The most recent version is supported with WordPress 5.0 and later.


## 9. Security Plugin
Currently, I am using Security Plugin called Malware,
MalCare accompanies an inbuilt smart and incredible Firewall for ongoing security from Hackers and bots.

It is the most straightforward WordPress Security module that needn’t bother with any specialized information. You can prepare a set in only 50 secs.

MalCare is trusted by Intel, Dolby True HD, CodeinWP, Site Care, WP Curve, and Valet, among others.

Not only Malware, but other plugins like Sucuri, and Shield, are excellent Plugins, and also come with a free variant, just try different plugins test out which is better for protection.
These days most of the bot attacks and hacking happen just to be safe from them we need to use the security plugins.


#  10. Some other plugins I use.
Really simple SSL, social sharing buttons, Cloudinary, Classic Editor,/ Vuukle or Disqus commenting Plugin, Advance Excerpt.

These are the plugins which really helpful one or the way. in the Basic blogging Website, if you want a more business-related website or any other feature then there are tons of plugins available in the WordPress store you can use them.


Note: I have not mentioned plugins that are helpful in woo-commerce and affiliate marketing I‘ll cover that part in the other blog.
If you know any other plugins which are better than these then mention them below in the comment box.
